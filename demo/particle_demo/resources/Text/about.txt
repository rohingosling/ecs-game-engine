ABOUT THIS PROJECT

  Particle Simulator is an academic project written in 2014 as part of an academic assignment. It was developed to
  explore the principles of Entity Component System (ECS) game engine architecture.

  The simulation demonstrates Newtonian gravitational attraction, short range repulsive forces, billiard ball collision
  mechanics, friction, and elasticity. Particles are organized into color coded groups, each with shared physical
  properties that can be configured through the settings menu.

ECS ARCHITECTURE

  The particle simulator demonstrates most features of the ECS Engine.
  The ECS Engine separates data from logic using three core concepts:

  - Entities are containers that represent objects in the simulation, such as particles, menus, and backgrounds.
  - Components are pure data holders attached to entities, storing properties like position, velocity, and mass.
  - Systems are stateless processors that operate on entities each frame, handling physics, rendering, collision
    detection, and user input.

  This separation allows game logic to be composed from small, reusable pieces rather than deep class hierarchies.
